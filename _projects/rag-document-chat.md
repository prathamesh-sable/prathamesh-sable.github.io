# RAG File Chat Application

**An advanced AI application for interacting with multiple file types using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).**

## Project Overview

This project started with learning about RAG on Colab through a following **YouTube tutorial** By <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mrdbourke">@Daniel Bourke</a>
, where I built the foundational RAG architecture from scratch.

I then expanded it to include LangChain for simplifying workflows, added a user-friendly **Streamlit UI**, and deployed the final application on **Hugging Face Spaces** for seamless access.

The application allows users to upload various file types (PDFs, Word documents, Text, MD Files) and chat with them using an AI-driven system. It combines robust AI models with intuitive usability.

## Project Version Repositories

1. **RAG: From Scratch for 1 PDF**: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/prathameshks/FileChat-Using-RAG)

2. **Conversion to Langchain Multiple Files**: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/prathameshks/RAG-using-langchain)

3. **Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces with Streamlit UI**: [Hugging Face Spaces Link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/prathameshks/FileChat-Using-RAG)

## Development Steps

1. **Started on Colab**: Followed a YouTube tutorial to create a basic RAG implementation from scratch.
2. **Integrated LangChain**: Simplified file handling and AI pipelines using LangChain.
3. **Built a Streamlit UI**: Designed an interactive web interface for easy user interaction.
4. **Deployment**: Hosted the final application on Hugging Face Spaces for public accessibility.

## Features

- **Supports Multiple File Types**: Chat with PDFs, Word, Excel, and more.
- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Leverages retrieval-augmented generation for context-aware interactions.
- **LangChain Integration**: Streamlines data ingestion and query handling.
- **Streamlit-Based UI**: Easy-to-use and visually appealing interface.
- **Deployed for Access**: Available on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Technology Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **LangChain**: Simplifies RAG workflows and query handling.
- **Streamlit**: For building a user-friendly web UI.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Deployment platform.
- **Google Colab**: Initial development and experimentation platform.
- **GEMMA 2**: LLM used for file understanding and response generation.
