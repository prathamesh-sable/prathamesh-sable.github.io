This project involved the development of a fully responsive portfolio website, deployed on GitHub Pages with a custom domain. The static content, including projects and other data, is managed using Jekyll, while forms and user management are powered by a Django REST API hosted on PythonAnywhere. The website was designed to display my work, skillset, and experience in a professional manner. Key features include dynamic content management, a blog section, and seamless integration with my social media profiles.
